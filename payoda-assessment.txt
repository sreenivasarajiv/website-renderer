Hi Sreenivas,
Create a Nodejs server with a REST API which provides any public website URL(e.g www.tutorialrepublic.com), Create an Angular application which consumes the API and shows the website contents as an embedded website.
Create two other pages of your own interest and use proper selectors,routers,component interactions and coding standards.
